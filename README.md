# Forecasting Employment Using VAR and ARIMA Models
Forecasting is more of an **art** than a science, however there are basic methodological steps and rules to follows. In this post, I offer a simple outline of these steps along with further resources to understand the theory behind time series data and forecasting. I utilize Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) on the series [PAYEMS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS), [TEMPHELPS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TEMPHELPS), and [ORNA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ORNA).
| For the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model, I use the series PAYEMS and TEMPHELPS: U.S. total non-farm employment levels and U.S. total temporary employment levels. 
| For the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model, I model and forecast Oregon's total non-farm employment levels.
